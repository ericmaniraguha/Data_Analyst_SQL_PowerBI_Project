## Data Loading and Data Model Creation

### Steps:
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from various sources such as databases, CSV files, or APIs.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleanse and transform the extracted data to prepare it for analysis. This may involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.
3. **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into the PowerBI tool.
4. **Data Modeling**: Create relationships between different data tables to establish a data model. Define measures and calculated columns as needed for analysis.

## Note:
`It is important to check datatype once you uploaded data in PowerBI for consistency and accuracy in your analysis.`

## Dashboard Design Process

### Steps:
1. **Identify Key Metrics**: Determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that need to be visualized on the dashboard.
2. **Layout Design**: Design the layout of the dashboard, including the arrangement of visuals, filters, and slicers.
3. **Visual Selection**: Choose appropriate visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables to represent the data effectively.
4. **Interactivity**: Implement interactive features like drill-down, cross-filtering, and tooltips to enhance user experience.
5. **Aesthetics**: Apply formatting, colors, and themes to make the dashboard visually appealing and easy to interpret.

## Publish and Share Report

### Steps:
1. **Publish to PowerBI Service**: Publish the completed dashboard to the PowerBI service for online access.
2. **Share with Stakeholders**: Share the dashboard with relevant stakeholders or team members via email or a shared link.
3. **Collaboration**: Enable collaboration features such as commenting and annotation to gather feedback and insights from stakeholders.
4. **Schedule Refresh**: Set up automatic data refresh schedules to ensure that the dashboard always reflects the latest data.

## Wrap Up and Conclusion

### Tasks:
1. **Documentation**: Document the process followed, including data sources, transformations, data model, and dashboard design decisions.
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and users to identify areas for improvement and future enhancements.
3. **Training**: Provide training sessions or tutorials to help users understand and navigate the dashboard effectively.
4. **Maintenance**: Establish a plan for ongoing maintenance, including periodic updates to data sources, dashboard enhancements, and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I can effectively load data, create a data model, design a dashboard, publish and share the report, and wrap up the project. This ensures that stakeholders have access to meaningful insights and analytics to support decision-making processes.
